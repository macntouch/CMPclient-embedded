## Continued in Forked  Project

Active development of this project is discontinued.

Development of the embedded CMP client is continued a forked project at
https://github.com/siemens/embeddedCMP



## Synopsis

This client-side example implementation of RFC 4210 “Certificate Management
Protocol (CMP)” utilizes [Arm® Mbed™ TLS](https://tls.mbed.org/) as crypto
library. It makes use of and is the reference implementatio for the library
available in [CMPclient-embedded-lib](https://github.com/nokia/CMPclient-embedded-lib).

It is mainly intended for use on constrained embedded IoT devices, e.g. based
on [Arm Mbed OS](https://os.mbed.com/), but will also work on any other system
supported by the Mbed TLS library. It is commonly tested on the NXP
Semiconductors’ FRDM-K64F development platform utilizing Mbed OS, and on Debian
Linux®.

Having the goal to be lightweight, initial focus is on providing basic support
for Initial Registration (IR/IP), protected by means of MSG\_MAC\_ALG based on
reference and secret values, as well as MSG\_SIG\_ALG based on external identity
certificates (cf. RFC 4210, E.7). Later, other CMP functionality such as those
for Key Update (KUR/KUP) could be added.

## Code Example

N/A

## Motivation

A fully featured CMP client based on OpenSSL exists, but it is not possible to
use it on ARM Mbed devices.  Also developers of other constrained devices might
prefer to select Mbed TLS over OpenSSL.

## Installation

### Download

If the code is cloned from GitHub, one might prefer to use the --recurse flag
to immeditaly also clone the CMPclient library and Mbed TLS which are
referenced as git submodules.

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/nokia/CMPclient-embedded.git

### Building

The CMP client can be built  using e.g. GCC for Linux, or the Mbed CLI and the
GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain.

#### GCC for Linux

The library (including the dependencies) can be build using make

    $ make

This results in the **cmpclient** executable

#### Mbed CLI and GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain

The GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain is one way to build for Mbed OS.

##### Installation and preparation for K64F

Information about the needed Mbed CLI can be found in the [Mbed OS documentation] (https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/5.1/dev\_tools/cli/).

On Debian the Mbed CLI can be installed like this:

    $ apt-get install python-pip
    $ pip install mbed-cli

The GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain can be downloaded from [here](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).

Preparing to build

    $ mbed config --global GCC\_ARM\_PATH [path of Toolchain bin]
    $ mbed toolchain GCC\_ARM
    $ mbed target K64F

##### Preparation and building

First, the dependencies need to be deployed:

    $ mbed deploy

Then, the firmware can be built:

    $ mbed compile

## Configuration / CLI Reference

There are no CLI options as of now, all information needs to be coded into the
executable.  The following configuration options exist and must be taken into
account before building and trying any executable.

### mbed\_app.json - for Mbed OS

* CA\_HOST - the host name or IP of the CMP server
* USE\_EASYCONNECT - true/false whether to use easyconnect or default (ethernet)
* network-interface - whether to e.g. use WiFi ESP8266
* wifi-ssid - the WiFi SSID
* wifi-password - the WiFi password

### cmpcl\_certs.h for MbedOS and Linux

The certificates and chain in PEM format to use for:

* External Identity Certificate
  * also the key
* CMP server certificate

### cmpclient.cpp

* HARDCODED\_SERVER\_HOST - if *not* building for Mbed OS
* HARDCODED\_CA\_NAME - the CMP server name if MSG\_MAC\_ALG is used and no
server certificate exists
* HARDCODED\_SECRET - the secret to use for MSG\_MAC\_ALG, if applicable
* HARDCODED\_REFERENCE - the reference to use for MSG\_MAC\_ALG, if applicable
* the code for configuring using PBM / MSG\_MAC\_ALG, commented out by means of
precompiler condition (#if 0), if commented in, MSG\_MAC\_ALG will be used

## Tests

Currently there are no tests.

## Beware

This is not yet to be considered as production grade code.
